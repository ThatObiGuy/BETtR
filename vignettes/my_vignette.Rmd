## Introduction

__BETtR__ is an R package designed to work with betting market odds data, providing tools for structuring the odds data in objects, visualising how the odds evolve over time, and providing a basic prediction method for betting odds trajectories.

This package is built around `bettr_data`, which extends a `tsibble` representation of event-level odds data.

This vignette will provide a brief overview of the intended workflow when using __BETtR__.

## Installing BETtR

To install __BETtR__ you first need to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). Installing [RStudio](https://posit.co/) as a nice desktop environment for using R is also recommended, however if available the use of an RStudio server should also be suitable.

Once in R you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('ThatObiGuy/BETtR')
```

at the R command prompt to install the latest development version of the package from the __BETtR__ [GitHub page](https://github.com/ThatObiGuy/BETtR).

NOTE: There is no official CRAN release of this package (yet), the above is the only way to install the __BETtR__ package.

Once you have run the above code, proceed with the following:

```{r}
library(bettr)
```

this will load in all the __BETtR__ functions. 

If you find bugs or wish to suggest new features please visit __BETtR__ [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/ThatObiGuy/bettr/issues).

### Creating a BETtR_data object

The base requirement to using this R package is the `make_bettr()` function. This function takes in a data frame containing betting odds and converts it into a `bettr_data` object.

The input data must contain:

* an event id
* logged time
* home, draw, and away odds

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bettr_obj <- make_bettr(raw_odds_data)
```

The return object inherits from `tsibble` and can be used with other methods provided by the package.

### Plotting odds

__BETtR__ provides a plotting method for `bettr_data` objects. Plots percentage change of the odds of a (or many) opening favorite(s) change over time.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(bettr_obj)
```

Odds are scaled relavtive to their opening value so that the movement across different events can be compared on a common scale.

### Predicting odds movement

`BETtR` includes a simple prediction method for objects of class `bettr_data`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
predict(bettr_obj)
```


### Example dataset

The package will include example betting odds datasets that have already been processed into `bettr_data` objects. These datasets can be used to experiment with the package functionality once finalised.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(epl_weekend_data)
plot(epl_weekend_data)
```
